# Task Solution README by Jozef Å vagerko

## Introduction
This README documents the step-by-step approach I used to resolve the given task, which involved debugging and fixing errors in a provided `index.html` file.

## Steps Taken

1. **Code Assessment**:
   Pasted the obfuscated `index.html` content from DevTools into my IDE to assess the code structure.

2. **Deobfuscation**:
   Utilized online tools and manual analysis to deobfuscate the code and rename variables to be more readable.

3. **Debugging**:
   Began debugging by addressing errors identified in the DevTools Console.

4. **Identifying Issues**:
   Discovered that `window.loadAndExecuteScript` function was responsible for errors due to a missing `.js` file.

5. **Verifying the Script URL**:
   Conducted a thorough check for typos and potential discrepancies in the script URL and its references in the code and DevTools network tab.

6. **Review and Removal**:
   After ensuring the script was indeed non-existent and not referenced elsewhere in the code, I concluded it was unnecessary and removed the function call.

7. **Final Testing**:
   Performed functional testing to confirm that the code operated correctly without the removed script. Ensured the matrix effect was running smoothly in the browser.

8. **Documentation**:
   Added detailed comments throughout the code for clarity and future maintainability.

## Testing Details

The final testing phase included visual confirmation of the matrix effect and monitoring the DevTools Console for any errors. The absence of any errors indicated that the removed script was not integral to the functionality.

## Conclusion

The code has been successfully debugged and the functionality has been verified. This README provides a transparent record of the methods used to resolve the given task.
